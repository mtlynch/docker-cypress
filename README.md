A utility image for Cypress testing framework.

## DEPRECATED

The Cypress team has created the [`cypress/included`](https://hub.docker.com/r/cypress/included) family of Cypress Docker images, which makes this repo and Docker image mostly unnecessary.

The only image that remains useful is [`mtlynch/3.2.0-chrome69`](https://hub.docker.com/r/mtlynch/cypress/tags), as Cypress still doesn't publish images with Cypress + browsers pre-installed.
